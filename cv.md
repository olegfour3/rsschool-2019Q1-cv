## Summary
I have experience in writing ( [HPDESIGN](http://hpdesign.ml) ) and editing (I had an internship in one company) sites, as well as in writing small programs and games in Delphi. Successfully passed the state exam in Java and MySQL.

It turned out to be very pleasant, to create something that you can use later on, so I would like to continue to develop in this direction. And these courses are a great chance for me to learn to do what I really like.
